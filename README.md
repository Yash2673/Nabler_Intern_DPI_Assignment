# Nabler_Intern_DPI_Assignment
This project is a part of an assessment by Nabler for their position Intern DPI. I needed to make a 'Get in Touch' webpage, fully responsive, with a form for the users to contact Nabler team. I had to do proper validations of all the fields in the form and save the data in Local Storage, Browser Cookies &amp; Session Storage after successful submission
